# Lambda School Machine Learning Syllabus

Machine Learning (ML) creates algorithms that can discover the shape of large datasets, datasets that are much larger than a human could ever compute in their lifetimes. All Machine Learning depends on the relationships of data in a high dimensional space. Models are mathematical expressions of the data, expressions that are too complicated to write out on a piece of paper.

Machine learning allows us to train a computer to perform certain human-like tasks like: recognizing written text, converting spoken language into symbols, piloting a car to stay between the lines on the road, recognizing faces, recognizing other objects in images, and identifying which variables have the greatest effect on certain outcomes.

The Lambda School approach to Machine Learning is designed to teach you, the student, how to use the latest and most advanced ML algorithms to produce meaningful results. Along the way you will become familiarized with the basics of the theory that built these algorithms and basic mathematical and programmatic approaches to building them. You will also learn about the importance of data: how to get it, how to prepare it for your models, and how to express it in interesting ways to others.
